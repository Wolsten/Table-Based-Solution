    <p>Different age ranges are often labeled with generational names based on shared experiences, cultural shifts, and
        technological advancements that shape their worldview. Here are a few examples provided by querying Chat-CGP
        (v3), with my commentary added:</p>

    <table class="timeline-table" title="Generations">

                    This generation came of age during a period of economic hardship and post-war recovery. According to
                    Chat-GPT:
                </p>

                <blockquote>they are often characterized by a strong work ethic</blockquote>

                <p>However, having a <em>strong work ethic</em> misinterprets cause and effect. The AI
                    model is correct that this generation was born in a time of economic hardship, but had no choice but
                    to work hard because there was little in the way of welfare to fall back on.
                    For later generations the model makes no reference to work ethic, even though
                    many social commentators argue that some people are lazier because of easy access to welfare and
                    widespread use of technology and automation.

                    This generation is characterized by being true digital natives, having grown up with smartphones,
                    social media, and instant access to information.
                </p>

                <p>According to ChatGPT:</p>

                <blockquote>they are often seen as diverse, entrepreneurial, and socially conscious
                </blockquote>

                <p>
                    but this is a value judgement, presumably introduced by being trained on gen-z weighted
                    data and trained by gen-z programmers. There is also evidence of this in the definition for
                    <em>millienials</em> but not so for previous generations. i.e. <em>feelings</em> become more
                    important for more recent generations.
                </p>

                <p>However, If you look back to the
                    activism of previous generations, such as those who wanted to <em>ban the bomb</em> then I
                    suggest that no particular generation has any better claim on being more moral than a previous one.
                    The AI definition is therefore somewhat narcissistic.

        As Chat-GPT cautions, it's important to note that these generational boundaries are somewhat arbitrary, and
        there can be variations in
        definitions. The terms are used to broadly describe shared experiences and characteristics within certain age
        groups.
