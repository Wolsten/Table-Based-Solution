            The Hadean is a geologic eon of Earth history preceding the Archean. It began with the formation of the
            Earth about 4.6 billion years ago and ended, as defined by the International Commission on Stratigraphy
            (ICS), 4 billion years ago. It's generally assumed that it started pretty much before everything else!

            I don't know if this is correct but I do know it happened a long time ago!
